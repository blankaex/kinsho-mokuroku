Wow convex is getting owned in blog frequency.

So I still haven't gotten over my recent inclination towards (re)watching older series, which means we're going to write opinions about _[[OF]: SOUL OF AND CONTROL AND THE C](https://shindanmaker.com/119209)_ today. More specifically, about the subs courtesy of one of my favourite fansubbing groups from back in the day: _gg_.

I always thought they were one of the coolest groups back then, and I definitely didn't think I'd be coming back to them in this kind of capacity. Especially after meeting [this idiot](https://uniquec.shinsen-radio.org/Fansubbers/Mango-chan.html). But I guess this is where we are in 2020, so let's have a look.

This was the first thing that caught my eye. There's nothing explicitly _wrong_ here, but "take" sort of implies you're going to keep the card whereas it's telling you to re-insert it. "Remove" would be more appropriate, since it wants you to try again. I only say this because I feel like it's a stock phrase that shouldn't really beget any creativity.

Again, I feel like this is most commonly just "Where to?". Not _wrong_ per se, but reading lines like this just makes the script seem really low effort. It's almost as if they didn't care and just wrote the first thing that came to mind. Really makes you ðŸ¤”.

Same deal as the previous lines, where it feels like the translator was already writing the line before they even finished listening to it and didn't bother to go back and change it into actual English. It's still in Japanese grammar. All you need to do here is swap the first two words.

As above, not wrong but very literal. He's asking Q what she thinks, so this line would make sense if the previous line was "I think...". Unfortunately, it was a really long-winded and autistic monologue, so it would help a lot to be more specific and just make it "What do you think?".

Looks like the metaphor didn't quite make it past the TL in this one. It's not so much "point of view" as it is "standing", as in "social standing". It's actually pretty abstract because he's refering to "standing" in regards to money, so it's more like the way people view the world is different depending on how much money they have.

Very true, by the way.

The article in the first line should be "the", since it's singular. Especially strange because it's referenced correctly in the very next line, and there's no room for ambiguity in the meaning after that. I want to say the inconsistent articles makes it wrong, but I'm actually not too sureâ€”both seem kind of awkward to me.

Funny you say that, I always thought gambling was a way to make money. The meaning sort of clicks after the second line, but each line should make sense on its own. Throwing in a "more" here would be a good start.

A fixed income is pretty terrible if you ask me. The word you're after here is probably "stable".

This line really makes it sound like he already has a wife and kids. That would be extremely unfortunate, even if you don't consider the fact that he's meant to be nineteen. Maybe wording it like "a wife and kids" would help.

I don't know how that second line became what it did. He's being smug to himself about not being a pain in the ass to everyone, and then he sees the notebook that Hanabi gave him and realises that he actually _was_ a pain in the ass to someone. Can't get much better than "Oh wait, I do...".

![](https://i.imgur.com/P4e09ob.png)

There was a clause in here with words to the effect of "at this age", as in the guy is saying no one at his age would be doing that kind of work on those kinds of hours. Definitely not a _gg_-exclusive mistake but worth pointing out since I _am_ technically reviewing the quality of the subs.

This one was pretty far off too. He's actually saying that Hanabi isn't the kind of girl who would date a guy just because he has money. Makes a lot more sense in context if you realise this. It's not super far off so I don't want to fault the translator as getting it wrong, but rather just being lazy.

Oh, I'm already at the end of the episode. That was a really strange blog, I feel like I didn't comment on nearly as many things as I usually do. That sort of makes sense though, now that I think about it.

Mainly because there weren't really any huge, glaring _errors_. Everything really just boiled down to super low effort and laziness; uninspired lines, no song TLs, not subbing perfectly audible background lines or important signs, just taking guesses at name spellings. But let's be real, that's what _gg_ really was.

Why did I even like them? Probably a toss up between the memes and not knowing any better. I guess it's nice to take off the rose-coloured glasses every now and then.
