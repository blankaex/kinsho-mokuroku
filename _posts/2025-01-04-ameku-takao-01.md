I haven't kept up with seasonal anime since like 2020, but I came across a JP MedTwitter account mentioning this show the other day. The novel the show is based on was apparently written by an actual doctor, and that got me interested in checking out the show.

So here's a quick blog of the first episode. The second episode is also available, but there isn't as much stuff to comment on.

Right off the bat, we see a prime example of why nobody wants to go into pediatrics except the few that really, really like working with children. The parents have a million questions (and complaints), and the kids won't tell you anything helpful.

There's a lot of information in this sign, and the translation is overall okay. Technically, dizziness would've been more appropriate than vertigo, although I'm not entirely sure if Japanese doctors make a clear distinction between めまい and 眩暈(げんうん). Also, the remark that the pulse is regular (整) was left untranslated for some reason.

Fair comment, but he's not doing much to move the diagnosis along. The most obvious approach here would be to perform a full neurological exam and get a detailed desription of the headache and the blurry vision from the patient. These could be the symptoms of a brain tumor, for example.

The terminology shown here feels outdated. It's better to call these values "reference values" (基準値) since some healthy individuals would statistically have measurements outside the reference range.

The original sentence was 筋肉の破壊は起こってないみたいですね (It looks like there's no muscle breakdown going on).

The translation sounds good on the surface but is a little problematic because the line is supposed to interpret what the previous sentence about creatinine kinase to the viewer, and not everyone will know what rhabdomyolysis means. Also, it makes the girl sound either smarter or *dumber* than she actually is, depending on your perspective. CK is not a specific test for rhabdomyolysis, and rhabdomyolysis is not really going to be on the list of differential diagnoses for this kid, so it wouldn't be smart of her to mention it. I think elevated CK in this context would actually suggest some sort of myopathy. I would go with a direct translation personally.

Nobody's going to answer yes to that question. You need to give examples. Fortunately, the MC shows how to do it correctly later in the episode.

Also, he can't even talk because of the pain. I would be extremely worried to just leave this guy alone without monitoring. At least get a family member to watch him. If this were a heart attack, he could be found dead after half an hour.

I think he's talking about the labs and imaging rather than the physical examination, so the phrasing here sounds a little confusing.

Acute abdomen, not acute abdominal disease. Also, "tenderness to touch" is something people would not really say since tenderness as a medical term already means pain upon touching.

The translation is off. It should read, "That (the CT scan) should tell us if he has appendicitis or pancreatitis." They were talking about appendicitis versus *gastroenteritis* in the previous line, which is different.

The original is a good line that shows the show's script was written or reviewed by someone with a medical background. Those would be the major things I'd be looking for in an abdominal CT scan for this patient.

I'm not sure about using "Investigative Pathology" for 統括診断部. How about integrative diagnostics? My guess is that the translator either didn't want it to sound too much like House MD or wanted to justify dealing with a lot of dead people in the show.

I'm also not sure about this stock translation for *yoroshiku* when she's not even in the same department.

Not this "pun" again. All it does is remind me of translating BRS in my dorm room back in college.

I wish fundoscopy was this easy. I call ophthalmology every time, and even they tell me they can't tell much from bedside exams half the time.

Again, don't count on a parent to heed a doctor's instructions.

Original sentence: 寄生虫が胃の中にいるってことですか？(You mean the parasite is in his stomach?)

The translation is kind of simplified. Anyway, what a dumb question for an intern. Where else would it be? She should be asking something like why it's not some other alternative diagnosis.

The CPR demonstrated in this show is horrible and is the main thing that prompted me to blog about the episode. In this scene, the monitor shows heart rate in the correct range for CPR (100-120 bpm), but the actual voice acting is way over 120 bpm. The guy on the phone is also not doing a good job at supplying the oxygen. You're supposed to bag air in a proper position, not just hold a mask over the face and hope the air gets delivered to the lungs.

The compressions will be nowhere deep enough in this position when you're moving. You're supposed to get on the stretcher with the patient as shown below:

In this scene, the senior doctor is just looking at the wound, not doing anything to minimize the bleeding (or wondering why the wound is not bleeding). Very strange. Just doing standard ACLS on a trauma case won't save the patient.

You do *not* stop chest compressions when you intubate! The compressions are far more important than switching from mask bagging to intubation.

Once the CPR scene was over, there wasn't much medical stuff to comment on because the patient was dead and there was no more medicine to do. Anyway, I know this is anime, but there should be a helicopter pad on the rooftop, not a random house for the MC.

Despite the minor stuff I've pointed out, I'd say the show is decent to watch overall. The MC is not too annoying yet, and the medical cases seem realistic enough for anime standards. Anyway, back to catching up on anime from five years ago.
