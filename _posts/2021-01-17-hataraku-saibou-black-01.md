I remember the original show being a bit boring, and I stopped watching it after a few episodes. Here's hoping that this spinoff will prove more interesting.

Something really bothers me about the use of "anyway" as a translation for *soredemo* in this exchange. It's not wrong per se, but the word "anyway" gives you the sense that the speaker is trying to end the conversation and move on. It does not have the same energy as something like "in spite of everything." Personally, I'd just take out the "anyway."

This is the casual way of phrasing it, but since the speaker specifically uses the word 脱核, it could've been a reasonable choice to go with the more precise term: enucleation.

RBCs can't really "join forces" because their negatively charged surfaces make them repel each other. They do stick together when there's a lot of positively charged stuff like antibodies in the blood sticking to them, which is generally not a good thing. Since RBCs fall faster from suspensions when they stick to each other, we use the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as a crude marker of inflammation. Anyway, the translation is fine. Let's not talk about commas.

Why are they traveling in opposite directions inside a single blood vessel? Why aren't any of them carrying oxygen? There has to be more to the story.

It should be "you," not "your."

They're talking about the gastric chief cell, which is a real type of cell in the stomach. It's not a random stomach cell that has been appointed the chief like the subs are suggesting.

No overtime here, just 168-hour workweeks.

This may seem like a weird translation, but it appears to be the official translation for the actual labor reform in Japan being mentioned (働き方改革).

Technically, the word "black" in this context comes from "black company," a Japanese term referring to companies with expoitative labor practices. It's not really correct English. The closest word I can think of right now is "shady," but the word "black" is also part of the title of the show, so it's tough to apply a one-time fix and forget. The localized title has "code black," which tries to work around the problem.

Ah, yes, "pespin."

This is not a translation error, but the first stage of digestion doesn't really happen in the stomach. It happens in the mouth. Try digesting a chunk of meat without moistening with saliva or chewing and see what happens. Alternatively, you could go real big brain and say the first stage happens in the brain and talk about the cephalic phase of digestion.

There are a few instances of unnecessary literal translations that stick out for me. I generally don't mind them as long as they don't take up too much screen space, but they do here with "you can't even compare it to before."

*Sonna* appeared two times in this episode, and both of them were translated as just "But..." But...

He's not talking about "next time." It's more like, "Bring more oxygen ASAP right now."

Sure. Some ICU patients on pressors have digital necrosis, but losing a few fingertips isn't a big deal when you're on the cusp of death.

I know the audio says *hito*, but I bet this would've been translated as a single *cell* in a fan release, along with some random molecular biology-themed puns sprinkled in.

Thank you for not using "kill" as a (wrong) translation for *korosu*.

"Reactive oxygen species," not "active oxygen." The translator also completely ignored the middle part of the sentence ("leading to oxidation of the illegally dumped cholesterol").

"Resistance" as a translation for 免疫力 (immunity) seems lacking. It's also disappointing that the scriptwriter didn't take the opportunity to make a 最近-細菌 pun.

Spelling is hard.

Cells (RBCs) don't turn into proteins (hemoglobins). What are you doing, Japan?

![](https://i.imgur.com/S1BIpi9.jpg)

They're explaining the technical term at the bottom, so might as well use "lyse". For what it's worth, pneumococci belong to the alpha-hemolytic group, which leaves the membranes of RBCs intact. The kind of brutal hemolysis depicted here would probably be closer to beta-hemolysis seen in other species.

Retrieve the CO2, not the O2. Translation error.

I don't like the song. Sorry.

All in all, I find it amazing how none of the characters have real names but the show somehow works. The cool-looking RBC senpai died in the middle of the episode, so I'll have to see if there are any other characters that catch my eye. Then again, RBCs are only supposed to live for like four months before they die anyway.
