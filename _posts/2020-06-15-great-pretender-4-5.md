Since blank asked (bugged?) me to review episode 5 of this show, I sat through the first five episodes. I would've reviewed episode 5, but Umi-chan (the bot) chose episode 4 for me. Plus, about 1/3 of episode 5 was action with lines like this:

which doesn't leave me with enough material for a blog post. You don't have to know Japanese to tell those lines are mostly just groaning and panting.

So here's a review of episode 4 plus some comments on episode 5.

Technically, the first line is more like, "Do you think you can become a lawyer (just) like Daddy?" Not every kid who wants to be just like their dad becomes one. To become a lawyer, getting good grades would be a start.

I can see where the translation came from, but he's already blaming Salazar for the weird dream with this line, so the tone is perhaps a bit off.

This probably counts as a major error. The first line is fine, but the next lines are talking about Japanese corporate culture in general.

> If he were Japanese, he'd be on it without complaining.

> Because they'd make you do it even if you complained. / Like they care about your complaints in Japan.

> Exactly.

I haven't been paying enough attention to tell if they mean actual cider or just "cider" in the Japanese sense of the word, which is basically Sprite. Fortunately, the answer doesn't matter for the purpose of the show.

Maybe this is slightly liberal for a translation of 打ちまくる, which puts more focus on him getting multiple hits, but then she's an NPC. Her lines don't matter.

"They're pretty filling." Talking about big ballpark hot dogs. Another inconsequential point.

Nothing really wrong with each line, but maybe you can edit the lines so the exchange seems less weird in isolation.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

![](https://i.imgur.com/NVN3oEA.jpg)

Maybe went a bit too far when the line is just 言ってろ, which is like "Oh, shut up. Like I care."

![](https://i.imgur.com/o5tDa1O.jpg)

This is just me being pedantic, but there's no mention of time of day in the original, and it doesn't look like nighttime.

The last line is key. When he says it's 割に合わない, it's not just about the money. He's saying running a gang is not worth it in a more general sense. The second line is also spoken in more general terms about how he was overloaded with work.

Now on to episode 5.

It's not entirely clear, but it's very possible that the first line is part of the lines said to Edamura over the transmitter, in which case it would be weird to refer to him in third person. A generic "It's almost time" would be a safer choice.

The word "narcotics" here bothered me because Abby's acting made Sakura Magic seem more like a stimulant than a narcotic. However, Edamura did claim it was based on heroin when he was pretending to synthesize it, so I guess we can count it as a narcotic.

He's trying to buy her off. A more literal translation for the second line is, "But everyone I've dealt with has been the same." The implication seems to be that he's confident she's not an exception to the rule, not that he wants to threaten her.

"Is this the only photographic evidence you've got?" There may be other forms of evidence.

Strange typo, but that's Japan for you.

"and everyone else" should be taken out from this line. AもBも全部 is just "both A and B" and not "A and B and everything else."

Overall, the subs are all right. I haven't paid too much attention to the subs in the previous episodes, but I did notice a couple of potentially important errors. One made it sound like the MC served actual prison time, and another made it sound like he was just feigning his interest in the Die Hot franchise.

As for the show itself? Entertaining but forgettable. A solid 2.5/5 from me. Minus 0.5 stars because they stuck with the annoying northern dialect for the MC.
