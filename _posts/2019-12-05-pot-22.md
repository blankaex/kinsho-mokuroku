Since we're like 100 episodes in with our pot rewatch, it's time for a review. I let Google choose a random number between 1 and 100 for me, and here we are.

First off, we should figure out how old this release is. The group's home page (as preserved in the Internet Archive) shows that the release happened in August 2002. That's years before the release of Aegisub, and I'm not old enough to know what tools people used to sub anime back then. 

Now on to the episode.

The good old "hai doesn't always mean yes" problem. He's saying he doesn't mind.

I try not to review song translations. It's overall decent but reads like a rough draft.

I don't think training routines are called "menus" in English. I guess "regulars" should be translated to varsity, too.

Interestingly, this is a very liberal translation otherwise. A literal translation would be "You just got off varsity practice, after all."

> 特別扱いは無し、ってのがうちの教育方針なのさ

I have no idea what happened to the second part of the sentence. It literally says "That's our educational policy," and I would try something like "That's our philosophy at Seigaku."

Apparently it's a regional thing, but people usually translate it as "purse."

It's very tempting to put a "but" at the end of the sentence when it ends with *kedo*, but it is not always correct. Let's look up *kedo* in the dictionary.

Basically, when used at the end of the sentence, it's not a "but" but rather an expression of uncertainty (or a wish, in the secondary definition), and there are other ways to get that across in English.

"Knowing him, he should be fine, I think."

I don't really understand the decision to use "that" *and* make it bigger here.

I like the "Punk!" but the rest of the sentence is too weak. It's probably already scratched, and it should be more threatening. More like I'll wreck you if you break my bike.

> なんか二人とも怒ってない?

"怒ってない?" by itself *could* mean "Both of them aren't mad (contrary to expectations)?" depending on the context and intonation. Not here, though.

"They're pissed, aren't they?"

"Looks like it's not broken."

That's a weird way to ask how a team is doing.

> 誰が補欠だ!

Momo's mad that Kamio called him a reserve player. The editing makes it sound like an innocent question.

The first line literally says "I mean, these guys / street tennis..." and you have to infer the missing verb to make sense of it.

"Hear me out. These jerks came along and dissed street tennis!"
"I called it a gathering of weak players, all right."

I'm not sure about just calling it "street tennis," either. Community tennis, maybe?

> 威勢のいいのもいいけど、ほどほどにな?

It's about the girl, not the other team. He's telling her she needs to chill.

![](https://i.imgur.com/duGf5oS.jpg)

> 愛される性格と言って欲しいね。

He's saying that he's likable and he can't help it.

> こだわってるな～

"Still upset, huh?"

![](https://i.imgur.com/tAqIV87.jpg)

"We should get out of here."

![](https://i.imgur.com/FDPa4eB.jpg)

Detail missed.

"That would be bad luck."

![](https://i.imgur.com/rd58gxU.jpg)

> かったりぃから一球勝負な

"Let's have a one-point game and get it over with."

![](https://i.imgur.com/dgVzlaK.jpg)

> 執念で返した

You could find a better word than "devotion" (tenacity?), but it sounds ridiculous in Japanese too in my opinion. It made me laugh, at least.

![](https://i.imgur.com/B54cGwz.jpg)

Got the name wrong.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NUbrxz0.jpg)

> 知らなくていいよ

It's Ryoma's response to Ibu asking what Inui Juice is. I like the translation.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8vz85cT.jpg)

They provided translations for the background lines, but they seem totally made up. He's grumbling about Ryoma not respecting him when he's a year older.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q50HK4u.jpg)

> でも試合の時はすんまそん

He apologized for injuring Ryoma at the last match, but there's no mention of it anywhere in the translation.

Need a more... positive word here.

> 取材に行かせてください

Not at all what she said.

Overall, it's a typical 00s fansub release. There were lines that were outright wrong as well as some lines that did not get the meaning across correctly due to phrasing issues, so I wouldn't trust the subs too much if anything seems confusing. Life is too short for anyone to bother re-subbing 178 episodes of this, however.
